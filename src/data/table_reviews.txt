This table is incredibly sturdy and was a breeze to assemble. Looks fantastic in our dining room.
I'm genuinely impressed with the quality for the price. It feels like solid, premium wood.
Arrived with a huge scratch right across the top. So disappointing and a hassle to return.
The assembly instructions were a complete nightmare. Vague diagrams and mislabeled parts. Took hours.
Perfect size for my small apartment kitchen. The modern design is exactly what I wanted.
It wobbles. A lot. We've tried tightening everything, putting it on different floors, nothing works. It feels unsafe.
The finish is beautiful and seems very durable. We've had it for months with no issues.
Much smaller in person than it appears online. Can barely fit four people.
Shipping was incredibly fast, and it was packed very securely. No damage at all.
The material feels cheap, almost like plastic-coated cardboard. I doubt it will last a year.
Great value for money. Looks like a designer piece that should have cost three times as much.
Several pre-drilled holes were misaligned. My husband had to re-drill them to get it assembled.
The color is a perfect match for my other furniture. Very happy with the purchase.
The surface scratches so easily. Just sliding a plate across it leaves a mark.
Super easy to clean and maintain. A simple wipe-down is all it needs.
It started chipping at the edges within the first week. Very poor quality finish.
This is a heavy, solid piece of furniture. It doesn't move or shake at all. Excellent build.
One of the legs was shorter than the others. We had to put a coaster under it to stop the rocking.
I love the minimalist design. It doesn't overwhelm the space.
The chemical smell from the varnish was overpowering. It took days to air out the room.
For the price, you can't beat it. It's a functional, decent-looking table.
Customer service was useless when I called about the missing screws. Had to buy my own.
The leaf extension mechanism is smooth and easy to operate.
It's an okay table, but the drawers are flimsy and don't slide well.
The wood grain is beautiful. Every guest we've had has complimented it.
The table was delivered to the wrong address. Took an extra week to finally get it.
Assembly was straightforward, took me about 45 minutes by myself.
The legs look much clunkier in real life than in the pictures.
Very versatile. We use it as a desk during the day and a dining table at night.
The top surface is not heat resistant at all. A warm mug left a permanent white ring.
Solid and stable, my kids haven't been able to destroy it yet, which is a miracle.
The packaging was a disaster. Styrofoam everywhere and it was still damaged.
I was hesitant to buy furniture online, but this table exceeded my expectations.
It looks nice, but it's a fingerprint magnet. I'm constantly wiping it down.
The height is perfect for our chairs. Very comfortable for dining.
One of the corners was crushed during shipping. The box was clearly dropped.
I appreciate that all the tools needed for assembly were included.
The table is functional, but it has a very 'basic' look. Nothing special.
The drop-leaf design is perfect for saving space in our tiny home.
The color is not what I would call 'oak'. It has a weird orange tint to it.
An amazing table for family game nights. Lots of space for everyone.
The bolts and screws are low quality; one of the heads stripped while I was tightening it.
This was a great purchase. Sturdy, stylish, and affordable. Highly recommend.
The table is fine, but the chairs that came with it are incredibly uncomfortable.
It's the centerpiece of our dining room now. We absolutely love it.
The veneer is already peeling away at the corners. Looks terrible now.
Cleaning is a breeze. Spills wipe right off without staining.
It's a bit of a beast to move around, so assemble it where you want it to stay.
The price was right, and it serves its purpose. No major complaints.
The gap between the table and the extension leaf is too wide. Crumbs fall right through.
Feels very high-end. The joinery is clean and the finish is even.
I wish it was a little bit wider, but overall it's a good table.
The legs are constantly coming loose, and I have to re-tighten them every few weeks.
A fantastic find! Looks just like a table I saw at a high-end store for a fraction of the price.
The description said 'solid wood' but it's clearly particle board with a thin veneer.
Easy assembly and a very sleek, modern look. Perfect for our new office.
The support bar underneath gets in the way of your knees. Poor design.
I'm very pleased with this purchase. It's exactly as described and pictured.
The package arrived without any instructions. Had to find a video on YouTube.
This table has survived two toddlers and a big dog. It's indestructible.
The lacquer finish is too glossy, it looks cheap and reflects the lights too much.
Great for crafting and projects. The large surface area is a huge plus.
The tabletop isn't perfectly flat, there's a slight bow in the middle.
I was able to assemble it by myself in under an hour. Very clear instructions.
The chairs don't tuck in all the way because of the pedestal base. It takes up a lot of room.
The rustic finish is lovely and hides minor scratches well.
The metal legs look cool but they scratch the floor. You'll need felt pads.
It's a solid, no-frills table that does its job well. Good for a first apartment.
The drawer is a nice touch for storing placemats and coasters.
Be warned, this thing is HEAVY. You'll need two people to move the box.
The table is nice, but delivery was a complete mess with multiple delays.
It has a simple, timeless design that will likely never go out of style.
The edge of the table is surprisingly sharp. I've bumped into it a few times.
Perfect for homework and family dinners. A great multi-purpose table.
The stain is uneven, with dark and light patches all over the surface.
I've had this for a year now and it's held up beautifully. Still looks new.
The matching bench is a great addition and saves space compared to chairs.
I regret this purchase. It's flimsy and looks cheap. Should have spent more on a better one.
This is a surprisingly good quality table for the price point.
The legs are attached with plastic brackets, which makes me nervous about its longevity.
The size is just right for our family of six. We can all eat together comfortably.
The white paint finish scuffs if you so much as look at it wrong.
We are very happy with our new table. It's both beautiful and functional.
It was a bit of a challenge to assemble, but the end result is worth it.
The wood is soft and dents easily. Not great for a family with kids.
A great addition to our kitchen nook. The round shape is very sociable.
I love everything about this table except for the fact that it was missing two bolts.
It’s a very attractive piece of furniture that gets a lot of compliments.
The extendable feature is clunky and difficult for one person to manage.
Excellent quality, especially considering the very reasonable price tag.
The actual color is much darker and less vibrant than the online photos.
This table has a classic look that fits well with my traditional decor.
It's stable enough, but I wouldn't recommend standing on it.
A perfect work-from-home desk. Spacious enough for two monitors and a laptop.
The smell of formaldehyde was very strong for the first few days.
It’s a stylish and practical table. Very satisfied with this purchase.
The assembly process was frustrating due to misaligned holes, but it's solid now.
